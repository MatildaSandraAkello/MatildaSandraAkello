## Background
I'm a graduate Quantity Surveyor whose passion for problem solving and technologies sparked a curiosity that led me into a self discovery journey down the paths of data science. Seeing as i had worked with Data before during my Undergraduate studies as part of my final year project assessment, i had prior knowledge in Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, reporting & presentation. My common habit of tracking and documenting almost everything that happens in my life and the discovery that i could leverage Machine Learning to easily find trends and draw insights from data sparked my interest in the field.
